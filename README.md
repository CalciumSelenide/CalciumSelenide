# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CalciumSelenide (abbrev: CaSe)
I am a Python enthusiast that is involved in STEM Pre-University Education. I find/think of a **lot** of projects, which means I have a tendency to work on multiple fronts simultaneously. But, why Python? 

Can you rapidly devlop with Python? Can you use it to teach kids of all ages how to interface with hardware and embedded systems? Can it aid in automation and development? Yes, yes, and yes! These are my use cases, and since it is a simple, easy-to-use language, I have selected it as my go-to.
